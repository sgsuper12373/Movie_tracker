4 dec 2025: 
	added pages for WebSeries with renaming files for understanding and readbiliyt
	added pages for Animated movies with renaming files for understanding and readbility 
	chages made in css of all four Anime, AnimeMovie, Movies, WebSeries  for consistancy and can be same file can be used for all 	
	added content inside AnimeMovies and WebSeries

	Future Plan's 
		add javascript to increase count of number of episodes and seasons watched for anime and web series
		two counter can be implimented season and episodes; 
		also using js instead of wrting / repeating same html structure for each content cards
		we can create a file and write card content and parse it using js and add cards to document 
		so code will be more readable and maintainable
10 dec 2025 12.24.00: 
	Idea of reading data from config file and redenring data using javascript won't work directly as there is no direct file 
	handling functionality in javascript. javascript can only read data from server. browser js can't read local files. 

	now I am just tyring to hardcode the data in javascript array and redering it using card creating function 
	This can be further exteded and http protocal can be used to read data from server and render it using javascript
	but before that I migth replicate code written for the WebSeries to other sections
